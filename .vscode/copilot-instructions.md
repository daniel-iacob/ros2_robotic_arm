# ROS 2 Robotic Arm Project Instructions
- Always use **ROS 2 Jazzy** syntax.
- When creating launch files, use **Python** (not XML).
- Our workspace path is always `/ros2_robotic_arm`.
- When suggesting build commands, always include `--symlink-install`.
- Assume the user is running inside a **Docker container** with X11 forwarding.
